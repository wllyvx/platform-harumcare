Donation Platform ✨
Hey there! Welcome to the Donation Platform repo! 🎉 This is my chill side project, thrown together in my spare time while sipping coffee or jamming to some lo-fi beats. Built with Astro JS and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and Express JS with MongoDB for the backend, this platform is all about making donations simple, clean, and user-friendly.
What's This All About? 🤔
This is a no-fuss donation platform where users can:

Create donation campaigns.
Browse existing campaigns.
(Hopefully soon) Enjoy cool features like notifications or an admin dashboard.

I built this to mess around with some trendy tech stacks and create something that could actually do some good. It's a work in progress, so bear with me!

Note: Since this is a spare-time gig, updates might come at a relaxed pace. Spot a bug or got a wild idea? Hit me up! 😎
